  - real estate listings
  - property recommendations
  - property searches
  - starting a restaurant, office, or any other business related to real estate rental or lease
  - property attributes such as size (평수), budget (보증금, 월세), or location

  For all other new or general questions, return "GENERAL".
  Only return either "SEARCH" or "GENERAL" as your response.
  Be sure to consider both the previous conversation history and the current message.`,
